# primerFileTransfer

After the manual process of aligning (using blastn) primer sequences (from literature) to fungene database, I am going to use the 'pcr simulater' from Jin <https://github.com/metajinomics/pcr_simulator.git> to do the whole process again automatically to double check. This project here is to change the format of primer file for 'blastn' to the format for 'pcr sumulator'. I just store the original java files here now since only I am using them. I may or may not transfer them to a command line tool in the future.
